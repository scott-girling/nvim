# Scott's neovim configuration

This is my personal neovim configuration. I use it as my daily driver. Yes, it doesn't have LSP.
Yes, it barely has any plugins. I used to use many, many plugins, worrying about keeping up,
changing to what plugin was cool and trendy. However, whilst I respect the incredible work that goes
into the neovim plugin community, I am totally comfortable being uncool and ancientâ€” even if people
frown and raise eyebrows when see my editor.
