# Scott's neovim configuration

This is my personal neovim configuration. I use it as my daily driver. Yes, it doesn't have LSP.
Yes, ~it barely has any plugins~ it has a couple plugins. I used to use many, many plugins, worrying
about keeping up, changing to what plugin was cool and trendy. However, whilst I respect the
incredible work that goes into the neovim plugin community, I am totally comfortable being uncool
and ancientâ€” even if people frown and raise eyebrows when see my editor.
